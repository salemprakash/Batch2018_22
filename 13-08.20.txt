Regular Expressions
# Create example character vector

# Apply grep function in R

# Apply grepl function in R

Apply grep & grepl with Multiple Patterns



Example:
From the list of Students in this group create a dataframe as df with two fields consisting of 6 students names as FirstName and Branch as Dept (Collection of all 4 Branches must). Find the exact match of CSE and IT Students in this dataframe.


# Apply regexpr function in R
#Integer vector of same length as text giving the starting position of the first match or -1 if there is none.


#regmatches to get the actual substrings matched by the regular expression.

# Apply gregexpr function in R
#Returns a list of the same length as text each element of which of the same form as the return value for regexpr.




Apply Function

#lapply
#Create a list with 5 marks in 
#english, maths, phy and chem
maths=c(64,45,89,67)
english=c(79,84,62,80)
physics=c(68,72,69,80)
chemistry = c(99,91,84,89)
